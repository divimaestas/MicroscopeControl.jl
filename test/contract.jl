# top level: `include` evaluates each form here at module scope regardless of
# the `@testset` block it is textually nested in, but `struct` still requires
# that top-level scope (not the local scope a testset body runs in).
# `dimensions` defaults to 1 so the no-arg form still exercises the plain
# `getposition` stub; passing 4 explicitly exercises `gui`'s own
# dimension-dispatch fallback (see "Stub throws" below).

# `StageInterface.gui` -- it creates a brand-new generic function local to
# this module, silently shadowing the real one. Must live at file top level
# (same reason as the dummy structs above: `module` cannot be declared inside
# a `@testset`'s local scope).

    # stage_interface/gui.jl dispatches by `stage.dimensions` to genuine
    # GLMakie-building code for every stage; camera_interface/gui.jl similarly
    # builds a real control figure) -- it is the *intended*, shared
    # implementation, not a vacuous stand-in for a missing device-specific one.
