"""
MicroscopeControl is the main module for the MicroscopeControl package.
It exports all abstract types and methods for instruments, as well as the
implementations for all hardware interfaces. It also provides methods for
saving data to HDF5 files, and the GUI methods for user interfaces.

Uses Reexport.jl to cleanly propagate exports from submodules.
